  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
```

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    year = 2019)

p2018_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 7, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    year = 2018)

pcombined_df =
  bind_rows(p2019_df, p2018_df) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```
